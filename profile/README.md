# Shiny Applications

Welcome to our collection of Shiny applications!

This GitHub organization serves as a central repository for interactive web applications built using Posit's Shiny framework in either R or Python
developed by [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) and contributors. Each application is maintained in its own repository, making it easy to find, 
use, and contribute to specific projects.

These applications are designed to make statistical concepts or data science ideas more accessible and interactive.

## Getting Started

To use any of the applications:

1. Visit the specific application's repository
2. Follow the installation instructions in the repository's README
3. Launch the application locally or access it through the provided URL (if hosted)

## Installation Requirements

Most applications require:

- R (>= 4.2.0)
- shiny
- Additional packages specified in individual repository README files

## Deployment

Applications can be deployed to:

- Static Web Hosts (e.g. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), ... ) using [Shinylive](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/shinylive.html).
